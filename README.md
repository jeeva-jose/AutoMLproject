# Operationalizing Machine Learning

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. This project aims to create the best model using Azure ML studio and Python SDK. Also, I have provided the steps followed. Here I consumed the provided dataset “bankmarkting_train” which contains the marketing campaign of a Portugal baking institution. The final goal is to predict the whether the client will subscribe to a bank team deposit (column y).

As part of the Automated experiment, I have done the following activities, using ML studio register the dataset, created Auto ML, choose the best model and deployed in (ACK instance, enabled the Application insight logging and Enabled Authentication). Tested the final endpoint with swagger documentation.

Part of the pipeline experiment done the following activities, used existing workspace, Attached existing AmlCompute, load TabularDataset , Configure AutoML using AutoMLConfig , Train the model using AmlCompute ,  Explore the results and tested the best-fitted model.


## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.

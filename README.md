# Operationalizing Machine Learning

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. This project aims to create the best model using Azure ML studio and Python SDK. Also, I have provided the steps followed. Here I consumed the provided dataset “bankmarkting_train” which contains the marketing campaign of a Portugal baking institution. The final goal is to predict the whether the client will subscribe to a bank team deposit (column y).

As part of the Automated experiment, I have done the following activities, using ML studio register the dataset, created Auto ML, choose the best model and deployed in (ACK instance, enabled the Application insight logging and Enabled Authentication). Tested the final endpoint with swagger documentation.

Part of the pipeline experiment done the following activities, used existing workspace, Attached existing AmlCompute, load TabularDataset , Configure AutoML using AutoMLConfig , Train the model using AmlCompute ,  Explore the results and tested the best-fitted model.
